class and object:a blue print or structure of a real world 
entity is called class which contains the information that 
can define or specify the characterstics of of that entity.
This real world entity is called object

reffrence variable: As we know that in python everything is
considered as object only. when we create object by calling
a constructor of any class it returns a object of that class,
and if we want to access the member and variable of that class
than we must have a reffrence to that function, this reffrence
is nothing but a reffrence variable
see program :'2_reffrence_variable.py'



about __init__():function and self
1 .__init__()->is a special method, which is know as constructor

1.the main purpose of __init__() is to declare and intialize the variable  of class(instance variable)
2. when create an object than it is executed automatically
2. the first argument to this method must be a variable which is pointing to the current obj,
   convetially know as 'self' but it can be any name
   see program '3_init_and_self.py'


# types of variable within the class:
    instance variable(object level variable):
        1.  instance variable the variable which may change from object to object
            pvm create copy allocate a single copy for each obj
        2.  in python it is create by the constructor (generally)
        
    static variable (class level variable)
        1.  static variable are the variable which never change from object to object and 
            same for all object.
        
    local variable (method level variable):
        1.  variable which are declared for logical use inside the method



# types of methods within the class
    instance method:method which uses the instance method
    class method:   method which uses the static variable
                    to declare a mehtod as class method we must 
                    use a decorator classmethod(i have used it in the program)

                    the first argument to the class method is variable which is 
                    pointing to the class obj created by the pvm.
    static method: method which don't use static and instance variable
