# # abstract method: a method which has no implimentation  
# # or partial imlimentation and only have declaration is
# # called abstract method

# # the implimetation of the method is provided by the child class
# # it is compulson for the child class. if child class has no impli-
# # mentation of the absract method then instnsiation (object creation) is not 
# # possible for child class



# # abstract class: a class which has incomleter implimentation such type of 
# # classes are called abstract class,each abstract class is a child of ABC
# # class,that is present in abc module.
