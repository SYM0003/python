excpetion: excpetion is unwanted event/incident which may cause gracefull termination of the program
           and because of the the excpetion program may not able to give us the desired output.Because of the
           exception  program may block the resouces of the system.


to avoid the blocking of the resouces and to get the desired output from the program program must have awarenace  of exception
handling. Exception handling is a concept of finding/ writing alternative code when excpetion occurs, so that program rich to the 
end and program would able to get the desired output. Exception handling reduces the probability of resouces blocking by the program.


finally block:
    it is the block which is used for cleanup activity more precisely we can say that whatever connection we created 
    inside the try block or except block will be disconnected by this block 
    the main spciality of this block is that it will run each and every time when the corrosponding try block will be run
