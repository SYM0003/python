packages are just a folder which contains the modules which has similar use
before python 3.2 a folder was called package if it contain a special file :__init__.py
but in new version it is mandatory

advantage of __init__.py file:
    if we import any package in our python file than this file is executed automatically.
    if we want to store any log info or flow info than we can use this file


installing package:

    need of installing package:
    if we want to use any package then it must present in the current working directory if it is 
    not present in current working directory than we won't be able to use that package and
    corresponding modules,if we want to romove this draw back and want to use the package through out
    our systme than we must have to install the package



    process of installing package:
    1 creat one special file in the same directory where the package is available with name setup.py
    2 import setup from setuptools in that file
    3 call setup() function
        setup() function takes some arg
        1. name=library_name-> you can use anything that you want
        2  version=library_version->you can use anything that you want
        3  package=list of package.
    4 now through cmd use this cmd in same working directory
    pip install .
    5. package installation is done
