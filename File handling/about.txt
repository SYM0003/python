In any programing language the data of the particular program can be accessed only when that 
program is in running state, once the program is completely executed the data is automatically deleted
and end user can not use that data.
File handling came into existanse to overcome this problem, with the help of file handling we can store 
the data of any program as a file(text,or binary),and also can asscess the data from any file


types of files :
1 text: abc.txt,xyz.py...
2 binary: (image and video files etc)

if the amount of data is is less than we can store it in file,else 
we should go for advanced option like database and bigdata


opening a file in python
open('file_name','mode')->returns a file pointer(curser)
file_name-> is the name of the file
mode-> mode can be defined as  what operation we want to perform on the particular file

supported modes:
'r'->read
'w'->write
'a'->append
'r+'->read and write
'w+'->write and read
'a+'->append and read
'x'->exclusive write mode


for binary files:

supported modes:
'rb'->read
'wb'->write
'a'->append
'r+b'->read and write
'w+b'->write and read
'a+b'->append and read
'xb'->exclusive write mode

with statement:
we can use with statement in file handling as below

with open(file_name,mode) as pointer name:
    body of with bloc


advantage:
1. automatic close the file after with block
2. create block for file handling seprately
