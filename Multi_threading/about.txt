Multi tasking:
    Performing multiple task simultaneously where is task is independant task is called multi tasking.
    In programing multi tasking can be divided into two categories:
    
    process based multi tasking:
        reffers to Performing multiple proesses simultaneously where is process is independant,is called
        process based multi tasking,this type of multi tasking is suitable at operating system level.being 
        a programmer, we do not need to know about it.
    thread based multi tasking:
        reffers to Performing multiple task simultaneously where is task can be treated as a part of a the program (thread)
        and each part is independant in themselves.this type of multi tasking is suitable at program level, and 
        being a programmer we must aware of it.


advantage of multi tasking:
    > efficiency.
